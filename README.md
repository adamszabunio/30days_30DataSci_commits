# 30days_30DataSci_commits
### This repository is my first 30 Days, 30 Commits Challenge. 
- Having just finished an accelerated Master's of Data Science, I am using this challenge to review a years worth of Data Science.
- To start, I jump right in with a refresher of Machine Learning. 
	+ In this [directory](machine_learning/): 
		+ Algorithms from scratch: 
			+ [Linear Regression](machine_learning/lin_reg/) (Day 1).
			+ [KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)](machine_learning/knn/) (Day 1).
			+ [Support Vector Machines](machine_learning/svm/) (Day 2).
		+ Object Oriented Programming 
			+ Implementing the Above Algorithms as a Python Class
				+ [SVM](machine_learning/oop/) (Day 2).
