# 30days_30DataSci_commits
---
### This repository is my first 30 Days, 30 Commits Challenge. 
- Having just finished an accelerated Master's of Data Science, I am using this challenge to review a years worth of Data Science.
- To start, I jump right in with a refresher of [Machine Learning](machine_learning/). 
	+ In this [directory](machine_learning/): 
		+ Algorithms from scratch (Day 1). 
			+ [Linear Regression](machine_learning/lin_reg/) 
			+ [KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)](machine_learning/knn/) 
			+ [Support Vector Machines](machine_learning/svm/)	
		+ Object Oriented Programming (Day 2).
			+ Implementing the Above Alogrithms as a Python Class
