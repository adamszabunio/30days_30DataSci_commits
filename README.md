# 30days_30DataSci_commits
### This repository is my first 30 Days, 30 Commits Challenge. 
- Having just finished an accelerated Master's of Data Science, I am using this challenge to review a years worth of Data Science.
- To start, I jump right in with a refresher of Machine Learning. 
	+ In the [Machine Learning directory](machine_learning/): 
		+ Algorithms from scratch: 
			+ [Linear Regression](machine_learning/lin_reg/) (Day 1).
			+ [KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)](machine_learning/knn/) (Day 1).
			+ [Support Vector Machines](machine_learning/svm/) (Day 2).
		+ [Object Oriented Programming](machine_learning/oop/)
			+ Implementing the Above Algorithms as a Python Class
				+ [SVM](machine_learning/oop/svm.py) (Day 2).
                + *Debugging of the SVM class (Day 3)
                    + The issue was due to TAB width inconsistency 
                    + Was remedied by setting a custom vimrc (configuration)
                    + More detailed explanation can be found in the [Object Oriented Programming directory](machine_learning/oop/)
