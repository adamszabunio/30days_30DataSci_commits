# Machine Learning
### In this directory, I follow the Machine Learning tutorials from the [sentdex youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ) and code up some of the staple machine learning algorithms. 
- In the [Object Oriented Programming directory](oop/), I take it a step further and code up the same algorithms as Python Classes.
